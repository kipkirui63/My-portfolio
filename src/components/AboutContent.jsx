            I'm a highly motivated individual ready to make a difference in the world of technology. 
             I have a strong grasp of JavaScript and react and I am always looking for ways to continue to grow my skill set and stay up to date with the latest trends.
             Driven by a desire to create engaging user experiences,
             I'm dedicated to creating code and products that are reliable and bug-free
            </p>
            <p >
              I'm quiet confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on
              improving my chops one design problem at a time.
            </p>

              If I need to define myself in one sentence that would be a willing to learn 
              person,and tech-obsessed!!!
